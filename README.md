# Seaborn-project-1
## About the Project
This project explores statistical data visualization using Seaborn, a Python library built on top of Matplotlib. The notebook demonstrates how Seaborn simplifies the creation of attractive and informative graphics for data analysis. Through hands-on examples, it visualizes categorical and numerical data, allowing for pattern recognition and comparison.

## Objective:

* The purpose of this project is to:

* Learn and apply key Seaborn functions for plotting

* Enhance understanding of data through visual exploration

* Use styling, color palettes, and grouping for better clarity

* Interpret real-world data using statistical plots

## Visualizations Used:

* Count Plot: Frequency of observations for categorical variables

* Bar Plot: Average values across categories

* Box Plot: Distribution and outliers in numeric variables

* Distribution Plot (hist/kde): Understand the shape of numerical data

* Heatmap : Correlation matrix visualization

* Each plot includes labeled axes, titles, and customized themes to improve readability and impact.

## Tools & Libraries:

* Python	: Core programming language

* Seaborn	: Statistical visualization

* Matplotlib :	Base for rendering Seaborn plots

* Jupyter Notebook	: Interactive development and documentation
