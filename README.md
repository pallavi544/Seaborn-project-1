# Seaborn-project-1
**About the Project
This project explores statistical data visualization using Seaborn, a Python library built on top of Matplotlib. The notebook demonstrates how Seaborn simplifies the creation of attractive and informative graphics for data analysis. Through hands-on examples, it visualizes categorical and numerical data, allowing for pattern recognition and comparison.

** Objective:

*The purpose of this project is to:

*Learn and apply key Seaborn functions for plotting

*Enhance understanding of data through visual exploration

*Use styling, color palettes, and grouping for better clarity

*Interpret real-world data using statistical plots

**Visualizations Used:

Count Plot: Frequency of observations for categorical variables

Bar Plot: Average values across categories

Box Plot: Distribution and outliers in numeric variables

Distribution Plot (hist/kde): Understand the shape of numerical data

Heatmap (if included): Correlation matrix visualization

Each plot includes labeled axes, titles, and customized themes to improve readability and impact.

** Tools & Libraries:

*Python	Core programming language

**Seaborn	Statistical visualization

*Matplotlib	Base for rendering Seaborn plots

*Jupyter Notebook	Interactive development and documentation
